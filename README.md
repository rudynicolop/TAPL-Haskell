# TAPL-Haskell
Haskell implementations of type systems as described in Benjamin Pierce's ***Types and Programming Languages***.

## Build and Run

Each program uses `cabal` to compile and run [(this book is a great resource)](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/)

To build and run follow these steps:

```bash
cd <name of project directory>
source ~/.ghcup/env
cabal build
cabal run
```
